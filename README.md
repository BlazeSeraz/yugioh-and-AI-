# Yugioh-and-AI-
In this small repository, I have gather 3 small codes that were generated using AI (ChatGPT4) to obtein some statistics for the deckbuilding procces of the YUGIOH card game. 
as such, don't take them too seriusly. It was made more like an experiment of what someone like me, with the most basic of what phyton can do (take in mind I myself do not know how to code). 
Some of the results are actually quite good, however I still haven't found a way to make cards as Pot of Duality work, it seems or I'm not giving clear enough instructions 
to ChatGPT or it still is not capable of writting and doing the effect of that card. 

Finally take no importance in the decklist. It is a very budget Floondereeze deck I have been running at locals.
